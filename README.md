# datascience-py
A data science project that involves building a machine learning model used for making accurate predictions using different regression algorithms

To run this project you have to open the combined.ipynb in a jupyter notebook or through google collab.

The aim of the project was to prepare an ML model which accurately predicted the Profit of a company based on its independent variables.
For this, various steps were taken into action such as Data Preprocessing, Checking the model accuracy, construction of different regression algorithms, model training, model testing, calculating the regression matrices, and choosing the best model. All of which have been mentioned in detail in the ipynb notebook. The final step involves deploying the trained model for future reference. 

The CSV file contains the data set of 50 companies that contain the independent and dependent variables such as R&D Spend, Administration, Marketing Spend and Profit. This data has not been processed or analysed before.

Combined.ipynb illustrates every step that is involved in the project.

X_train.pkl and scaler.pkl are the two pickel modules that are created after saving the trained model using pickel. X_train.pkl contains the trained machine learning model and scaler.pkl consists of the scaled object.

I have aslo attached a powerpoint for further clarification.
